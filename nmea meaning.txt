$GPGSA, $GNGSA, $QZGSA - GNSS Active Satellites and DOP 

This sentence provides details on the nature of the fix.

It includes the numbers of the satellites being used in the current solution and the DOP. DOP (dilution of precision) is an indication of the effect of satellite geometry on the accuracy of the fix. It is a unitless number where smaller is better. For 3D fixes using 4 satellites a 1.0 would be considered to be a perfect number. For over determined solutions it is possible to see numbers below 1.0. There are differences in the way the PRN's are presented which can effect the ability of some programs to display this data. For example, in the example shown below there are 5 satellites in the solution and the null fields are scattered indicating that the almanac would show satellites in the null positions that are not being used as part of this solution. Other receivers might output all of the satellites used at the beginning of the sentence with the null field all stacked up at the end. This difference accounts for some satellite display programs not always being able to display the satellites being tracked.

If multiple GPS, GLONASS, etc. satellites are used, separate GSA sentences with different talker IDs are sent.

$GPGSV, $GLGSV, $QZGSV - GNSS satellites in view 

Number of satellites (SV) in view, satellite ID numbers, elevation, azimuth and SNR value.

Four satellites maximum per transmission, additional satellite data sent in second or third message. Total number of messages being transmitted and the number of the message being transmitted is indicated in the first two fields. If multiple GPS, GLONASS, etc. satellites are in view, separate GSV sentences with different talker IDs are sent.

The fields are:
•1 - Sentence identifier. The three NMEA talkers are: ◦GPGSV - GPS 
◦GLGSV - GLONASS 
◦QZGSV - QZSS

•2 - Message number (see note 1), 1 to 9

•6 - Elevation, degrees (90 degrees maximum) 
•7 - Azimuth, degrees true, 000 to 359 
•8 - SNR (C/No) 00-99 dB-Hz, null when not tracking

NOTE 1 Satellite information may require the transmission of multiple messages, all containing identical field formats. The first field specifies the total number of messages, minimum value = 1. The second field identifies the order of this message (message number), minimum value = 1. For efficiency it is recommended that null fields be used in the additional sentences where the data is unchanged from the first sentence.

NOTE 2 One to four sets of "Satellite ID-Elevation-Azimuth-SNR" are allowed per message. Null fields are not required for unused sets when less than four sets are transmitted.

NOTE 3 Satellite ID numbers. To avoid posssible confusion caused by repetition of satellite ID numbers when using multiple satellite systems, the following convention has been adopted:
•GPS satellites are identified by their PRN numbers, which range from 1 to 32. 
•The WAAS system has reserved numbers 33 through 64 to identify its satellites. 
•Numbers 65 through 96 are reserved for GLONASS satellites. ◦GLONASS satellites are identified by 64 plus satellite slot numbers. 
◦The slot numbers are 1 through 24 for the full GLONASS constellation of 24 satellites, thus giving a range of 65 through 88. 
◦The numbers 89 through 96 are available if slot numbers above 24 are allocated to on-orbit spares.

$PGLOR,1,SMx - Report GPS Summary Information 

Pseudo-NMEA sentence $PGLOR,1,SM1 reports summary information about the current first fix (FF) or first measurement.

This is typically information known up to the last piece of protocol is sent to an AGPS network entity (e.g. control plane or SUPL server).

Pseudo-NMEA sentence $PGLOR,1,SM2 reports summary information about the network consequences of reporting the first fix or measurement. This is typically information that indicates network reaction or acknowledgement of GPS activities that may or may not happen.

See $PGLOR,FIX for information about subsequent fixes.

Summary 2 Sentence 

  $PGLOR,1,SM2,<TYPE>,<ACK>,<NTIME>*CC

Where:
•PGLOR Proprietary NMEA sentence identifier for Broadcom

•1 Version 1 of this sentence 
•TYPE of summary report: ◦PROTO - Local bearer protocol send status. 
◦POS - The network has compute-position status.

•ACK Success or failure of the network type: ◦ACK - Success: the protocol was sent or position received. 
◦NAK - Failure.

•NTIME Time from end of session sent until this message received. Unit are seconds. 
•CC Standard NMEA checksum
